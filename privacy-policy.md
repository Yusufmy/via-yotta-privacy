## 9. Data Usage in App-to-App Transactions

2. When selecting the Cashlez payment method, the VIA app sends a payment request to the Cashlez app.
3. The transaction is processed within the Cashlez app.
4. After a successful transaction in Cashlez, the app sends the transaction result response to the VIA app.
5. The VIA app captures the entire response from Cashlez and sends it to the VIA backend for final transaction status verification.

We ensure that all transaction data captured and transmitted between VIA and Cashlez remains secure and complies with applicable privacy policies.
